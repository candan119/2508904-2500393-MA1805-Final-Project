OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
This is a 2D "Tomb Raider"-inspired action-adventure game focused on fast-paced escape challenges. Players navigate maze-like temple levels while dodging hazards like patrolling enemies, lasers, and falling boulders. The game starts with a dramatic treasure chest interaction that triggers a temple collapse, launching the player into a series of timed escape levels. Key technical features include a tile-based maze system, AI enemies with basic pathing, environmental traps, and a scoring system based on treasure collected. The game's aesthetics draw from ancient ruins, with themes of urgency, danger, and treasure hunting.

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION
Each team members should write a detailed explanation of their individual contribution to the project.
Be specific: 50% of your mark will be based on your individual contributions, so your marker needs to
know exactly what you contributed. Explain your process and how you went about it. What research did
you do? How did you implement your contributions into the project? What challenges did you face? How did
you overcome these challenges (note: realising that it would be beyond the scope of your project is
not a failure! Explain what you did instead to keep in scope. Balancing your ambitions versus the
practical possibilities within the time and technical constraints is a key skill here!). This should be
detailed and clear, and include *any* contribution you made to the project.

THEMES
The main themes of this project are greed, consequence, and urgency within an ancient, mysterious environment. Inspired by "Tomb Raider"-type narratives, the game explores the idea that taking forbidden treasure unleashes danger. We plan on introducing this theme through an opening interaction with a treasure chest — a simple but symbolic choice that triggers the collapse of the temple. While the choice itself doesn’t branch into different outcomes, it acts as a catalyst for the game's core mechanic: survival under pressure.
