OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
Basically this game is a basic understandning of our workshops put in into practice by our creation of games as levels. This is a 2D "Tomb Raider"-inspired action-adventure game focused on fast-paced escape challenges. Players navigate maze-like temple levels while dodging hazards like patrolling enemies, lasers, and falling boulders. The game starts with a dramatic treasure chest interaction that triggers a temple collapse, launching the player into a series of timed escape levels. Key technical features include a tile-based maze system, AI enemies with basic pathing, environmental traps, and a scoring system based on treasure collected. The game's aesthetics draw from ancient ruins, with themes of urgency, danger, and treasure hunting.

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION

Alya: She generally made most of the coding. She created the levels and the core coding for the characters movements or the so called villians. She also made the background designs. She used the tilemaps method that was mainly thaught at the end of the term as her center codes for the game. The game based on that code and got upgraded within the making. She went into research in new terrortories as well as stuff that has been thought through out the lecture which made her gain new knowledge about code and improve herself in code based game making. They both brainstormed and developed the games basic idea and structure.  

Candan: She made all the props and character designs. She has not directly made most of the code for the game yet she analyized the code through out the writing proccess and clear out any errors that has been made through out the proccess. She generally did the writing and explanation sides of the code such as the read me file. These has made her get more familiar with the actual code that was written way better. They both brainstormed and developed the games basic idea and structure.   

THEMES
The main themes of this project are greed, consequence, and urgency within an ancient, mysterious environment. Inspired by "Tomb Raider"-type narratives, the game explores the idea that taking forbidden treasure unleashes danger. We plan on introducing this theme through an opening interaction with a treasure chest — a simple but symbolic choice that triggers the collapse of the temple. While the choice itself doesn’t branch into different outcomes, it acts as a catalyst for the game's core mechanic: survival under pressure.

DESIGN
The designs are quite simplistic to avoid the game becoming confusing. Mostly basic art it can even be considered as pixel art for the character and the background. 


AESTHETIC DIMENSIONS
We wanted to keep it as simple as possible so we could have focused on the coding prospect of it more. We were influenced by the example game in the lecture by its simple nature. As well as other games has been influential for us in the aesthetic choice such as Fireboy and Watergirl

UNREALISED ASPECTS OF PROJECT
If we had more time we would probably try to create a couple more levels and be more detailed or elobarative in the aesthetics of the game. But also being a group of two has put quite a significant amount of work on both of us since code writing or solving the errors has become quite stressful time to time with busy personal lives as well.
